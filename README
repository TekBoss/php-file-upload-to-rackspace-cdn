=============
PHP scripts are a Rackspace Cloud File Uploader.

To use these files you will need ...

1. Rackspace Username for your Cloud server
2. Rackspace API Key for your Cloud Server
3. A "container name" where files will be stored on your Cloud server.

These files include a library (/lib) provided by Rackspace.
Always use the latest library which can be found here: GitHub rackspace  / php-opencloud 

See https://github.com/rackspace/php-opencloud

There are other actions that this script can be modified to provide (see comments at end of uploader.php)
but this specific function (uloading a single file to a Rackspace Cloud Server with PHP) seems
to be the most popular request and I could not find one anywhere.

Enjoy!
